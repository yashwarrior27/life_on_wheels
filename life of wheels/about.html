       <p>Entrepreneur Manas Goel and his mother were always taking travel ventures by road. The only hold-up was the constant discomfort, restlessness, and inconvenience that came along with the long hours of travel. It was certainly no picnic having to stop every few hours for his mom to take a stretch to relieve her back issues, either. </p>
       <p>
        Manas and his mom realized there certainly had to be a better way. One where they could kick back, relax, maybe watch some TV, and eat some food during their inter-city travels. One where they could travel in luxury, with all the amenities one needs to turn their on-road travel experiences from drag to fab. This led to a lightbulb moment for Manas’ mom–why not take your home and all your requisites with you on the go? 
       </p>
       <p>
